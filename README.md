# Introduction to machine learning
This course provides a short introduction to supervised machine learning.

The course consists of two lectures and three problem sets.

## Lectures

The lectures are:

* AM: An introduction to unsupervised machine learning methods. This covers:
  * What is meant by machine learning?
  * How do supervised and unsupervised methods differ?
  * Unsupervised ML methods:
    * Projection methods (PCA, sparse PCA)
    * Manifold methods (tSNE and UMAP)
    * Clustering (k-means, GMM)
* PM: [An introduction to supervised machine learning methods](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/presentations/intro_to_supervised_ml.html). This covers:
  * Linear regression
  * How supervised machine learning models are trained?
  * Over- and under-fit models and validation / testing sets
  * Logistic regression

## Problem sets

AM:

* [clustering and PCA](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_unsupervised_problems.nb.html). Here, participants code up their own k-means classifier and apply it to the Iris dataset. The answers for this problem set in R are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_unsupervised_problems_answers.nb.html).

PM: There is a choice of problem sets for the afternoon

- [using linear regression to predict house prices](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_linear_regression_problems.html). Here participants apply linear regression modelling and investigate how the model complexity affects its performance on training, validation and testing sets. The dataset used in the problem set is [here](./problem_sets/data/housing_short.csv). The answers to this exercise are in both [R](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_applied_regression_answers.nb.html) and [Python](https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_applied_regression.ipynb).

- [*Linear regression*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_linear_regression_problems.nb.html). Here, participants train their own linear regression model and investigate how the hyperparameters of gradient descent affect training efficiency. The answers to this problem set are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_linear_regression_problems_answers.nb.html).
- [Logistic regression](https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_creating_logistic_regression.nb.html). Here, participants code up their own logistic regression mdoel and use it to determine the factors which influence passenger survival on the Titanic. The dataset for this problem is [here](https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/data/titanic.csv). The answers to the problem set are [here](https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_creating_logistic_regression_answers.nb.html).
