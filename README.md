# Introduction to machine learning
This course provides a short introduction to supervised machine learning.

The course consists of two lectures and three problem sets.



## Lectures

The lectures are:

* AM: [An introduction to unsupervised machine learning methods](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/presentations/intro_to_ml_unsupervised.html). This covers:
  * What is meant by machine learning?
  * How do supervised and unsupervised methods differ?
  * Unsupervised ML methods:
    * Projection methods (PCA, sparse PCA)
    * Manifold methods (tSNE and UMAP)
    * Clustering (k-means, GMM)
* PM: [An introduction to supervised machine learning methods](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/presentations/intro_to_supervised_ml.html). This covers:
  * Linear regression
  * How supervised machine learning models are trained?
  * Over- and under-fit models and validation / testing sets
  * Logistic regression



## Problem sets

AM:

* [clustering and PCA](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_unsupervised_problems.nb.html). Here, participants code up their own k-means clustering algorithm and apply it to the Iris dataset. The answers for this problem set in R are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_unsupervised_problems_answers.nb.html).
* [dimensionality reduction (and a bit of clustering)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_problems_unsupervised_learning.nb.hlml). This allows students to explore a range of clustering methods (including k-means and Gaussian mixture models) and apply these to the Iris dataset. In the second part, the students can explore dimensionality reduction methods applied to the MNIST dataset. The answers for this problem set in R are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_problems_unsupervised_learning_answers.nb.html).

PM: There is a choice of problem sets for the afternoon

- [using linear regression to predict house prices](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_linear_regression_problems.html). Here participants apply linear regression modelling and investigate how the model complexity affects its performance on training, validation and testing sets. The dataset used in the problem set is [here](./problem_sets/data/housing_short.csv). The answers to this exercise are in both [R](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_applied_regression_answers.nb.html) and [Python](https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_applied_regression.ipynb).

- [*Linear regression from scratch*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_linear_regression_problems.html). Here, participants build and train their own linear regression model and investigate how the hyperparameters of gradient descent affect training efficiency. The answers to this problem set are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_linear_regression_problems_answers.nb.html).
- [Logistic regression](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_and_unsupervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_creating_logistic_regression.nb.html). Here, participants code up their own logistic regression model and use it to determine the factors which influence passenger survival on the Titanic. The dataset for this problem is [here](./problem_sets/data/titanic.csv). The answers to the problem set are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_creating_logistic_regression_answers.nb.html).
